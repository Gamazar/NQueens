# NQueens
This is my first GitHub repository, so it'll be a bit messy.For this particular project, I am implementing a solution using nested loops
to determine the legal placement on the chessboard. However, while thinking about this problem, I did not just want to print out one 
solution. Instead, I made it where I am able to printo out all 92 solutions to the 8-Queen challenge problem. 

I initially had a MakeFile and Changelog, but was not pushed with the file. Looking more into it.
